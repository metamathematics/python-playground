10) Nesting. Write a data structure that represents your personal information; name (first, middle, last)
    age, job, address, email address, email address, and phone number. You may build the data structure
    with any combination of built-in object types you like (lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings, numbers),
    Then, access the individual components of your data structures by indexing. Do some structures make
    more sense than ohers for this object?

11) Files. Write a script that creates a new output file called myfile.txt and writes the string "Hello 
    file world!!" into it. Then write another script that opens myfile.txt and reads and prints the 
    contents. Does the new line show up in the directory where you ran your scripts? What if you add a
    different directory path to the filename passed to open?
